<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi! I'm Martin. Storytelling and movement-making is part of my roots as an African from Northern Uganda. 
  My story starts with over 8 years of professional experience in performing arts - in dance, theatre, and tribal music. 
  Now, I'm a Digital Animation student in my final year at The Animation School in South Africa.
</p>

<p>I have transformed my artistry as a performer into a specialist in character rigging, and character animation. 
  My understanding of the body and movement gives me the ability to create dynamic characters that can mimic both real-life and cartoon-like behaviors.</p>
